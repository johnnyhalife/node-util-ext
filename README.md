node-utils-ext
==============

Common &amp; useful functions that extend the Util class in NodeJs. Basically these are all those functions that you usually 
carry between projects and repos. Ideally centralized in a single lib, distributed through NPM and easy to use.

Basically, if you are already using `util` module from NodeJS just do this


``` javascript
var util = require('util'); // this is how you have it now

var util = require('util-ext') // this is how you add support for extended util functions 
```

Take a look at the code to see the available functions.
